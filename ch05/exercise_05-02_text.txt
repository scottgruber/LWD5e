<article><header>  <p>posted by BGB, November 15, 2016</p></header><h2>Low and Slow</h2><p>This week I am extremely excited about a new cooking technique called sous vide. In sous vide cooking, you submerge the food (usually vacuum-sealed in plastic) into a water bath that is precisely set to the target temperature you want the food to be cooked to. In his book, Cooking for Geeks, Jeff Potter describes it as ultra-low-temperature poaching.</p><p>Next month, we will be serving Sous Vide Salmon with Dill Hollandaise. To reserve a seat at the chef table, contact us before November 30.</p><p>blackgoose@example.com555-336-1800</p><p>Warning: Sous vide cooked salmon is not pasteurized. Avoid it if you are pregnant or have immunity issues.</p></article>
